Implementation of the Log-linear classifier and the MLP1 classifier - Upgrading Assignment 1 in Deep Learning course using PyTorch.

In this exercise i stopped computing gradients by hand, and moved on to using a software library - PyTorch - that provides
automatic differentiation capabilities through the computation-graph abstraction.
